Mediatype to add support for ntfy.sh services

Seems like noone added support for ntfy.sh into zabbix, so i spent some time to get it working myself.
Might aswell share it. Pullrequests are welcome.

Download the xmlfile, and go to Alerts -> Mediatypes and click import.
Change the URL field to your server, and Click enabled.
Go to the usermaneger, and add the mediatype to your user.
